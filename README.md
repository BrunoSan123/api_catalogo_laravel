## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework. You can also check out [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Testing notes (project-specific)

- Unit tests: placed under `tests/Unit` and use mocked `ProductRepositoryInterface` to exercise controller logic without external services.
- Feature tests: placed under `tests/Feature` and use SQLite in-memory (`RefreshDatabase`) for speed. This satisfies the exercise requirement and keeps CI fast.
- Elasticsearch: feature tests mock the `ElasticsearchService` so they don't require a running ES instance. If you need end-to-end verification against a real Elasticsearch, run the stack via Docker Compose and execute the integration test described below.

Running tests

Inside the project (or inside the `app` container):

```bash
# run all tests
php artisan test

# run only unit tests
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit

# run the ProductApiTest feature
php artisan test --filter ProductApiTest
```

End-to-end integration (MySQL + Elasticsearch)

1. Start the Docker stack: `docker compose up -d --build`
2. Run migrations against MySQL: `docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --force`
3. (Optional) Seed: `docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder --force`
4. Run integration tests (example): `docker compose exec app php artisan test --filter Integration` (you'll need to add integration tests in `tests/Feature` that do not mock `ElasticsearchService`).

Justification: using SQLite in-memory for tests keeps them fast and deterministic; the README documents how to run full integration tests when required.
